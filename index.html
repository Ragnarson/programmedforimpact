          The Archangel Contest has finished and we have to admit that all of the contestants exceeded our expectations. Their creativity and fresh views on software that could make the world a better place were amazing. But one out of all submissions was so special, that we have decided to single out and support this idea no matter what.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let us introduce to you <strong>the winner of the top prize of Archangel Contest - <a href="http://1for.com/hunger/">1FORhunger project</a> of Najeeb Khan</strong> and <strong>Mashkur Reza</strong>. They presented the idea of sharing meals with those in need in a very interesting and non-invasive way for the donors.<br>
          No one will describe the purpose of <a href="http://1for.com/hunger/">1FORhunger</a> better than the trailblazers themselves. Here is short description of the idea submitted by Najeeb and Mashkur:
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>‘Imagine anytime you buy a meal, you’re giving a meal to someone in need. That’s what we’re doing with 1FORhunger and we have provided over 5,000 meals so far. The idea is already being implemented, however, we don't have the technical human capital and financial to make the app a reality. It would help us evolve from our MVP (currently a texting format) into an app. The app would allow us to create a stronger incentive for more restaurants to sign on and thereby feeding more people. It would take approximately 1 month to build the app if I could wave a magic wand. Imagine seeing exactly where’s your food, when to help and which restaurants nearby are helping feed people. You would not only do more social good, but could also compete against your friends to see how many meals you've donated to feed people. It's a win-win-win!’</i>

          Winning the top prize is not only a winner's title and front row seat on the Archangel Summit. It’s also a great opportunity to use Ragnarson software development services to move the idea to the next level. Currently, Najeeb is closely working with Ragnarson’s team on further development of 1FORhunger idea, choosing the right project team and technology.

          So you're an entrepreneur with a ground-breaking idea for the world's next web-based application. That's great! One catch: you lack the technical skills to build the software, and make your idea a reality. That's where we come in. We are Ruby developers specialized in building web applications for start-ups. Together, we can surely realize your vision and bring your product to market sooner than you thought possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          Development of web applications is our core business. We love working with the Ruby programming language and we use it on daily basis. Other technologies and frameworks are chosen individually, based on the needs of each project. From a business point of view, most of our work falls into one or more of the following 4 areas:

          <ul>
            <li>Rapid Minimum Viable Product (MVP) development</li>
            <li>Long-term development of post-MVP products</li>
            <li>Maintenance of existing and legacy projects</li>
            <li>Teaching and passing on good practices for software development and maintenance to your local team</li>
          </ul>
